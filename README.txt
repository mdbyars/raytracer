I attempted to implement every aspect of the assignment. 
My shilouette, gradient and b asic files run as expected. 
My metal and other material files work as expected except for 
phong which continues to have unexpected behavior. All 
the intersection frameworks are implemented according to the pseudocode. 
However, I could not get a test to work in the intersection tests file. 
I tried several different classes but none of them would run unfortunately
even after working with the TA for hours. 
I created my own material based on vanta black which absorbs almost all light. 
My original art is based on this which is the interaction of a vanta black table 
with a glass ball (called originalPiece.png in the basic repo). Not extremely creative but I found it to be interesting in 
this context. I hope you do too! Overall this project was very informative 
but many aspects refused to work after 10+ hours of debugging and help from the 
professor and TA. I absolutely did my best and I believe I understand the mechanics.
